How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

How do I approach designing software?

I approach software design by compiling a requirements checklist and decomposing needs into objects and methods. I then start developing solutions and go over them again to optimize them. This has worked well so far, but a broader and deeper strategy would be beneficial.
